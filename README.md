# OpenAutomod
An alternative to Discord's broken built-in server automod

This code comprises the source code for a discord bot I wrote whose purpose is to either replicate or entirely replace the features offered by Discord's built-in automod. Discord's automod is poor in features, customization, and documentation, so I wrote a better one. 
The features aren't identical to what discord offers (suspected spam messages are defined by repetition rather than length, for example), but are much more robust and easier to customize.

If you're hosting this on your own, you'll need to install sqlite3 and discord.js on your machine.
